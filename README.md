# Thread-Project
Awesome thread project that calculates the sin, cos, and tan values for a given angle based on their taylor series.
Each trig function has it's own thread. The user can enter the number of terms in the series. The more terms,
the more accurate the value. Since the program uses Java's BigInteger Class, there is virtually no limit to how many terms can be calculated, although it gets pretty time consuming for terms higher than 400ish :p
