# Thread-Project
Awesome thread project that calculates the sin, cos, and tan values for a given angle based on their series.
The user can enter the number of terms in the series. The more terms, the more accurate the value. Since the 
program uses Java's BigInteger Class, there is virtually no limit to how many terms can be calculated, although it
gets pretty time consuming for terms higher than 400ish :p
